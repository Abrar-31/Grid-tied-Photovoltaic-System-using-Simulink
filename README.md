# Grid-tied-Photovoltaic-System-using-Simulink

Modeled and simulated a grid-tied photovoltaic system in Simulink, incorporating MPPT using the Perturb and Observe (P&O) algorithm for optimized energy extraction.

Integrated key components including PV arrays, boost and bidirectional DC-DC converters, and a lithium-ion battery for effective energy management in both on-grid and off-grid scenarios.

Explored inverter control and grid synchronization, with potential research directions in MPPT algorithm comparison, ripple minimization, and hybrid renewable integration.
